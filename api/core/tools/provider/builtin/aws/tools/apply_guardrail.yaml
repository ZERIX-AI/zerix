This API is capable of evaluating input prompts and model responses for all Foundation Models (FMs), including those on Amazon Bedrock, custom FMs, and third-party FMs. By implementing this functionality, organizations can achieve centralized governance across all their generative AI applications, thereby enhancing control and consistency in content moderation.
